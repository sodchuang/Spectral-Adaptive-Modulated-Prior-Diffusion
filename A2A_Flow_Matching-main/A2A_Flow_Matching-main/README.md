# A2A: Action-to-Action Flow Matching Policy

A2A is a flow matching policy that directly transforms history action distributions to future action distributions, conditioned on visual observations. This repository provides the implementation of A2A algorithm built on top of the [RoboVerse](https://github.com/RoboVerseOrg/RoboVerse) platform.

## Overview

A2A (Action-to-Action) uses flow matching to learn a transformation from history states to future actions, enabling efficient and robust imitation learning for robotic manipulation tasks.

### Architecture

```
History States [s_{t-n+1}, ..., s_t] --encode--> history_latents (x_0)
Visual Obs [img_{t-n+1}, ..., img_t] --encode--> obs_latents (condition)

Flow Matching: x_0 --flow(condition)--> x_1 (future_action_latents)

x_1 --decode--> Future Actions [a_t, a_{t+1}, ..., a_{t+k}]

## Real-Robot Deployment

Deploying A2A on a real robot involves additional considerations beyond simulation. The following notes summarize practices we have validated and recommend for a smooth real-world setup.

### Prerequisites

Before moving to real-robot experiments, we **strongly recommend** the following progression:

1. **Reproduce simulation results first.** Make sure you can reproduce A2A's advantage over baselines reported in the paper within simulation. This validates your training pipeline and gives you a reference point for debugging real-world issues.
2. **Get Diffusion Policy working on the real robot before A2A.** DP serves as a sanity check for your data collection, observation pipeline, and low-level controller. Once DP runs reliably, switching to A2A is straightforward.

### Recommended Setup

- **Develop your real-robot API on top of this repo.** Porting A2A to a different codebase tends to introduce subtle bugs (action normalization, observation alignment, history buffering). Staying within this repo and adding a real-robot interface is the path of least resistance.
- **Robot arm: Franka is recommended.** We have thoroughly validated A2A on Franka and the integration is essentially plug-and-play. Other arms are supported in principle, but expect some debugging effort around the control interface and others.

### Key Implementation Notes

- **Prefer continuous action signals.** A2A is grounded in the physical continuity of actions, which makes it most effective for tasks dominated by smooth, continuous control signals. For discrete or switch-like action dimensions (e.g., binary gripper open/close commands), this continuity prior provides limited benefit. Consider handling such dimensions with a separate head or post-processing.

- **Use *executed* actions as the flow source, not commanded actions.**

  > To enhance closed-loop robustness, the flow source should be the history of **executed** actions inferred from proprioceptive feedback, rather than the actions previously commanded by the policy. This accounts for imperfect low-level tracking and prevents compounding errors at deployment time.

- **Add small Gaussian noise to history actions during training.** This improves robustness and preserves multi-modality of the learned distribution. We recommend a standard deviation of **0.02** as a good default.

### Troubleshooting

Real-robot deployment inevitably surfaces setup-specific issues. Don't be discouraged if the first few rollouts behave unexpectedly — iterate, log proprioceptive feedback, and compare against your simulation runs. Feel free to open an issue if you run into problems we can help with.
